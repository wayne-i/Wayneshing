DESCRIPTION: This code creates a simple shoe store application using Tkinter with a login page and a store interface. The login page requires the user to enter a username and password, and if the credentials are correct ("Wayneshing" and "obrador010205"), the user gains access to the store. In the store interface, the user can view a list of shoes, each with a size and price, and add selected shoes to their cart. They can also view the cart with the total price, checkout to generate a receipt, and view the action history (e.g., adding items to the cart or completing a purchase). The program is divided into classes: Shoe for representing individual shoes, ShoeStore for managing inventory and the cart, and ShoeStoreUI for the user interface. The LoginPage class handles the login functionality. After successful login, the user can interact with the store, manage their cart, and checkout.
